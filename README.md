Project 02: Print a Pattern of Numbers

Spring Semester, 2024

Function:

Write a Java program to print a pattern of numbers.

Requirement: 

Write a Java program to repeatedly display a menu. User selects one item from the menu to print a pattern or terminate the program. After selecting a menu item (item 1 to 3), the user will continue to select a number from 1 to 9; then the program will print the patterns. For each selection of an menu item, the program will print 4 patterns.

			1.	Item 1: Triangle patterns 
	 
			2.	Item 2: Pyramid patterns
	 
			3.	Item 3: Diamond patterns
	 
			4.	Item 4: exit
	 

The sample output in the appendix are the patterns of numbers after the user has entered value 5.

Grading:

The project is graded based on implementation, modularity, performance, and coding style.

Submission:

A Java source file.
